# Rock Paper Scissors Game
This is a simple implementation of the classic game "Rock Paper Scissors" in Python. The game allows a user to play against the computer by choosing one of the three options: rock, paper, or scissors. The winner is determined by the rules of the game: rock beats scissors, paper beats rock, and scissors beats paper.

# How to Play

The program will prompt you to enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors) in the terminal.
Once you have entered your choice, the computer will randomly select its choice.
After both the user and the computer have made their choices, the program will determine the winner and display the result.
The game will continue until you decide to quit.
# Rules

Scissors beats paper.
